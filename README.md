# Medical-Cost-Personal---Prediction (Linear Regression)

The present dataset consists of seven variables related to medical expenses of American citizens. Such variables are Age, Sex, BMI, Children, Smoker and Region. We will use the linear regression technique to estimate medical expenses. We seek to answer questions such as the medical expenses of a 30-year-old non-smoker and childless woman living in the southeastern US.
